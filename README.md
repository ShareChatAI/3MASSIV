This is an official pytorch implementation of our CVPR 2022 paper [3MASSIV: Multilingual, Multimodal and Multi-Aspect dataset of Social Media
Short Videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14456.pdf). 3MASSIV is a human-annotated, multimodal and multilingual dataset containing short videos uploaded to a leading short-video social media platform - [MOJ](https://mojapp.in/) by [ShareChat](https://sharechat.com/).
